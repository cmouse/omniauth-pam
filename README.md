# OmniAuth PAM

Allows you to authenticate against PAM using OmniAuth.

## Usage

    use OmniAuth:Strategies::PAM

There are no configuration options. It's been tested under Debian 6.0 and Ruby 1.9.3-p0, but there's no reason why it won't work anywhere which doesn't have PAM correctly configured.

Then navigate to '/auth/pam'.

On Debian/Ubuntu you will need the `libpam0g-dev` package to compile the [rpam](https://github.com/canweriotnow/rpam-ruby19) gem.Others, I don't know.

This strategy only supports Ruby 1.9. [Read here about 1.8 support](http://nickcharlton.net/post/pam-for-omniauth).
