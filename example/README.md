# omniauth-pam example

This is a very simple example to demonstrate how OmniAuth::PAM can be used within a
primitive [Sinatra][] application.

You can start it by doing:

```bash
[sudo] gem install bundler foreman
bundle install
foreman start
```

Preferably from within the Vagrantfile included in the root of the repository.
